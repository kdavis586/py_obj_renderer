# py_obj_renderer
Very basic implementation of an Obj class that represents a .obj file. This object can then be used with its ```render``` function to be dislayed to a screen using pyopengl.

# Dependencies
```pyopengl```

# For Windows
Installing pyopengl via ```pip install pyopengl``` might not work. In this case, download from here https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyopengl
and install using the command ```pip install <path_to_downloaded_file>```
